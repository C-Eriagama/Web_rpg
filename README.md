## Project Information:
I created this game as a fun way to learn and practice HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
By building an RPG adventure, I could delve into the fundamentals of web development while flexing my creative muscles. 
From designing engaging landscapes with CSS to implementing interactive gameplay elements with JavaScript, every aspect of the game served as a hands-on lesson in web development.
Whether slaying monsters or facing off against the dragon, the journey of building this game was as rewarding as the skills I gained along the way.
